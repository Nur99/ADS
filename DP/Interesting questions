1. How many minimum insertions you should do to make string an palindrome? 
At first, let's answer to this question. How many insertions should be done to make two string identical? 
Answer of second question is easier, we should find longest common subsequence and it's answer will be seemed like that:
  s1.size() - LCS + s2.size() - LCS
Making a string a palindrome means that we should make the given string and it's reverse identical )))
So answer will be like that. 
  s.size() - LCS + reversedS.size() - LCS;
